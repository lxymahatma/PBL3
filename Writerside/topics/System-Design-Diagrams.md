| **Description**          | This use case allows a user to register a new account in the system. The user provides necessary details, which are validated and stored in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Actors**               | User, UserService, DatabaseService, RegisterPage, RegisterViewModel, IRegisterViewModel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Preconditions**        | The user is on the registration page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Postconditions**       | The user account is created and stored in the database. The user is informed of successful registration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Normal Flow**          | 1. User selects "Register" option on the application interface..2. System presents a registration form on the User Interface..3. User enters registration details..4. User Interface captures the data and validates the input..5. User Interface sends data to UserService..6. UserService validates the data..7. UserService sends validated data to DatabaseService..8. DatabaseService stores the user data..9. UserService confirms the successful registration to the User Interface..10. User Interface displays a success message to the user. |
| **Alternative Flow**     | **Invalid Input**: If the input data is invalid, UserService returns an error message..2. User Interface displays the error message and prompts the user to correct the input..3. User corrects the input and resubmits the form..4. The system processes the corrected input as described in the Normal Flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Exceptions**           | **System Error**: If there is a system error during the registration process, an error message is displayed to the user..2. The user may try to register again later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Special Requirements** | The system should ensure the registration form is easy to use and accessible. The data should be validated for correctness and completeness before submission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Assumptions**          | The user has access to the registration page and intends to create a new account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Actor**: User

**System Components**: User Interface, AuthenticationService, Database

**Sequence Steps**:

| Step | Description                                                                                                                           |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User initiates the registration process by accessing the registration form on the User Interface.                                     |
| 2    | User fills out the registration form with necessary details (username, password, email, etc.).                                        |
| 3    | User Interface sends the filled-out registration form data to the AuthenticationService.                                              |
| 4    | AuthenticationService receives the registration data and performs initial validations:                                                |
|      | - Validates the format of the email.                                                                                                  |
|      | - Checks if the password meets the security criteria.                                                                                 |
|      | - Ensures the username is not already taken (involves a quick check with the Database).                                               |
| 5    | If any validation fails, AuthenticationService sends an error message back to the User Interface, which then displays it to the User. |
| 6    | If all validations pass, AuthenticationService hashes the password and prepares the data for database entry.                          |
| 7    | AuthenticationService sends the validated and processed data to the Database to create a new user record.                             |
| 8    | Database attempts to create a new record:                                                                                             |
|      | - Checks for uniqueness constraints again (to prevent race conditions).                                                               |
|      | - If successful, confirms the creation of the user account.                                                                           |
|      | - If it fails (e.g., due to a username now being taken), it sends a failure message back to the AuthenticationService.                |
| 9    | AuthenticationService receives the response from the Database:                                                                        |
|      | - If the account creation is successful, it sends a success notification to the User Interface.                                       |
|      | - If the account creation fails, it sends the appropriate error message to the User Interface.                                        |
| 10   | User Interface receives the final response and informs the User:                                                                      |
|      | - Displays a success message and possibly directs the user to a login page or a confirmation email is sent.                           |
|      | - Displays an error message if the registration failed, asking the user to try different credentials or contact support.              |

| 2    | Users will be prompted to enter basic information such as email, password, username, and other details. |
| 3    | The system will verify the email address entered by the user.                                           |
| 4    | If the email exists, the user can go to the next step.                                                  |
| 5    | If not, the system will go back to the register account day.                                            |
| 6    | The system will ask the user whether they agree to our terms of use.                                    |
| 7    | If the user agrees to the terms, account registration will be completed.                                |
| 8    | If the user does not agree to the sales, registration will fail and return to the register account day. |

| **Preconditions**        | The user has an existing account and is on the login page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Postconditions**       | The user is authenticated and granted access to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Normal Flow**          | 1. User selects "Log In" option on the application interface..2. System presents a login form on the User Interface. User enters their username and password..4. User Interface captures the data and sends it to UserService..5. UserService validates the credentials..6. UserService sends a request to DatabaseService to verify the user..7. DatabaseService checks the credentials and confirms authentication..8. UserService confirms successful authentication to the User Interface..9. User Interface grants access to the user. |
| **Alternative Flow**     | **Invalid Credentials** If the credentials are invalid, UserService returns an error message. User Interface displays the error message and prompts the user to try again..3. User re-enters credentials and resubmits the form..4. The system processes the new input as described in the Normal Flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Exceptions**           | **System Error**: If there is a system error during the login process, an error message is displayed to the user..2. The user may try to log in again later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Special Requirements** | The system should ensure the login form is secure and protects against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and brute force attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Assumptions**          | The user has valid login credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User accesses the login form on the User Interface.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2    | User enters their username and password into the form.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3    | User Interface sends the login credentials to the AuthenticationService.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4    | AuthenticationService receives the credentials and performs initial checks:<br/>- Validates the format of the username and password.<br/>- If the format is incorrect, it sends an error message back to the User Interface. |
| 5    | If the formats are correct, AuthenticationService hashes the password and sends the username and hashed password to the Database for verification.                                                                           |                                                                                                                 |
| 6    | Database checks the hashed password against the stored hash for the given username:                                                                                                                                          |
|      | - If the username does not exist, it returns a "user not found" response.                                                                                                                                                    |
|      | - If the password does not match, it returns a "wrong password" response.                                                                                                                                                    |
|      | - If both match, it returns a "login successful" response along with user data if necessary.                                                                                                                                 |
| 7    | AuthenticationService receives the response from the Database:                                                                                                                                                               |
|      | - If the login is successful, it may generate a session token or other security credentials and sends a success message along with any user data to the User Interface.                                                      |
|      | - If the login fails, it sends the appropriate error message (e.g., "wrong username or password") to the UserInterface.                                                                                                      |
| 8    | User Interface receives the final response and informs the User:                                                                                                                                                             |
|      | - Displays a welcome message and transitions the user to the dashboard or homepage if login is successful.                                                                                                                   |
|      | - Displays an error message if the login failed, offering the user the option to try again or reset their password.                                                                                                          |

|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User logs into the system and navigates to the account information page.                              |
| 2    | User Interface sends a request to UserProfile to retrieve the user's information.                     |
| 3    | UserProfile sends a query to the Database to fetch the user's details.                                |
| 4    | Database retrieves the information and returns it to UserProfile.                                     |
| 5    | UserProfile receives the data and sends it to the User Interface.                                     |
| 6    | User Interface displays the user's account information (e.g., username, email, name, academic level). |

|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User selects the option to edit their account information on the same page.                     |
| 2    | User Interface allows the user to edit fields such as email, name, and academic level.          |
| 3    | User makes changes and submits the updated information.                                         |
| 4    | User Interface sends the updated details to UserProfile.                                        |
| 5    | UserProfile validates the new information and sends an update request to the Database:          |
|      | - Checks for the format of the email.                                                           |
|      | - Validates that the name does not contain invalid characters.                                  |
|      | - Ensures that the academic level is within the allowed range.                                  |
| 6    | Database updates the user's information and confirms the update back to UserProfile.            |
| 7    | UserProfile receives the confirmation and notifies the User Interface of the successful update. |
| 8    | User Interface informs the User that their information has been successfully updated.           |

|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User navigates to the login page and clicks on the "Forgot Password" link.                                |
| 2    | User Interface prompts the User to enter their email address.                                             |
| 3    | User enters their email and submits the request.                                                          |
| 4    | User Interface sends the email address to AuthenticationService.                                          |
| 5    | AuthenticationService validates the email format:                                                         |
|      | - If invalid, it sends an error message back to the User Interface, which then displays it to the User.   |
| 6    | If the email format is valid, AuthenticationService checks with the Database to confirm the existence of  |
|      | the account associated with the email.                                                                    |
| 7    | Database returns a response:                                                                              |
|      | - If no account is associated, it sends a "no account found" response to AuthenticationService.           |
|      | - If found, it sends a "user verified" response.                                                          |
| 8    | AuthenticationService:                                                                                    |
|      | - If the user is verified, it generates a password reset link with a unique, time-limited token.          |
|      | - Sends the reset link to the User's email.                                                               |
| 9    | User receives the email and clicks on the password reset link, which redirects them to a password reset   |
|      | page.                                                                                                     |
| 10   | User Interface displays the password reset form where the User can enter a new password.                  |
| 11   | User enters a new password and submits the form.                                                          |
| 12   | User Interface sends the new password to AuthenticationService.                                           |
| 13   | AuthenticationService validates the new password against security criteria:                               |
|      | - If the password does not meet the criteria, sends an error message back to the User Interface.          |
|      | - If it meets the criteria, hashes the password and sends it to the Database for updating.                |
| 14   | Database updates the password and confirms the update to AuthenticationService.                           |
| 15   | AuthenticationService notifies the User Interface of the successful password reset.                       |
| 16   | User Interface informs the User that their password has been successfully reset and redirects them to the |
|      | login page.                                                                                               |

| 2    | The user can enter an email address or username to connect the account.                                     |
| 3    | The system will confirm whether the account exists.                                                         |
| 4    | If the account does not exist, the system will return to the beginning.                                     |
| 5    | If the account exists, the system will send a password reset link to the user’s email address. The password |
|      | reset link will be valid for one hour.                                                                      |
| 6    | If the user enters it in time, then they can reset the password.                                            |
| 7    | If not, the user will not be able to reset the password and will go back to the forgot password page.       |
| 8    | After resetting the password, the system will show the confirm password reset message.                      |

| **Normal Flow**          | 1. User navigates to the account page on the application interface..2. System presents the account information form on the User Interface..3. User selects the option to delete their account..4. System prompts the user to confirm their decision..5. User confirms the deletion and provides their password for verification..6. User Interface captures the confirmation and password, then sends it to UserService..7. UserService validates the password..8. UserService sends the deletion request to DatabaseService..9. DatabaseService deletes the user account from the database..10. UserService confirms the successful deletion to the User Interface..11. User Interface displays a success message to the user and logs them out. |
| **Alternative Flow**     | **Invalid Password**:.1. If the password is invalid, UserService returns an error message..2. User Interface displays the error message and prompts the user to enter the correct password..3. User re-enters the password and resubmits the form..4. The system processes the new input as described in the Normal Flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Exceptions**           | **System Error**:.1. If there is a system error during the deletion process, an error message is displayed to the user..2. The user may try to delete their account again later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Special Requirements** | The system should ensure the account deletion process is secure and protects against accidental or unauthorized deletions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 3    | User Interface prompts the User to confirm their decision:                                                       |
|      | - This may include entering their password again for verification and clicking a "Confirm Deletion" button.      |
| 4    | User enters their password and confirms the deletion.                                                            |
| 5    | User Interface sends the password and deletion request to AuthenticationService.                                 |
| 6    | AuthenticationService verifies the password with the Database:                                                   |
|      | - If the password is incorrect, it sends an "invalid password" response to the User Interface, which informs the |
|      | User.                                                                                                            |
|      | - If the password is correct, it proceeds with the deletion process.                                             |
| 7    | AuthenticationService sends a command to the Database to delete the user's account.                              |
| 8    | Database performs the deletion:                                                                                  |
|      | - Removes all records associated with the user's account (personal information, settings, data, etc.).           |
|      | - Confirms the deletion to AuthenticationService.                                                                |

| 1    | User logs into the system and navigates to the course recommendation feature.                                                                                  |
| 2    | User inputs a natural language query describing their course interests or requirements in the search field provided on the User Interface.                     |
| 3    | User Interface captures the query and sends it to the Query component.                                                                                         |
| 4    | Query component parses the query to extract essential keywords and search parameters, then sends this refined data to the OpenAIAPI.                           |
| 5    | OpenAIAPI analyzes the refined query to further understand the context and intent, extracting key topics and terms relevant to courses.                        |
| 6    | OpenAIAPI sends the analysis results back to the Query component.                                                                                              |

| 8    | CourseRecommendation uses the received keywords and terms to formulate a database search query.                                                                |
| 9    | CourseRecommendation sends the search query to the Database to find matching courses.                                                                          |
| 10   | Database retrieves courses that fit the criteria and sends them back to the CourseRecommendation system.                                                       |
| 11   | CourseRecommendation processes the list, possibly ranking the courses based on relevance to the query, popularity, and other criteria.                         |
| 12   | CourseRecommendation sends the final list of recommended courses to the User Interface.                                                                        |

| Step | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User logs into the system and navigates to a specific thread in the community forum, where the User Interface displays the thread with existing posts and an option to add a new post.     |
| 2    | User selects the option to create a new post, and the User Interface presents a form for entering the post's content.                                                                      |
| 3    | User enters details for the new post and submits the form, while the User Interface captures the input data and sends it to the PostManagement component.                                  |
| 4    | PostManagement validates the post details for inappropriate content or format errors and sends a create request to the Database.                                                           |
| 5    | Database stores the new post, assigns it an identifier, and links it to the thread, then confirms the creation back to PostManagement.                                                     |
| 6    | PostManagement receives the confirmation including a success message and details about the new post (e.g., post ID, timestamp) and notifies the User Interface of the successful creation. |
| 7    | User Interface displays the newly created post within the thread and confirms to the User, making the post live in the thread for others to view and respond to.                           |
