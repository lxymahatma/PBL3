| Preface                           | This document outlines the expected readership and provides a version history of the requirements specification for the Course Recommendation System. It summarizes the rationale behind each version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Introduction                      | The Course Recommendation System is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing students with personalized course recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This system will integrate with existing university databases and scheduling tools to offer a seamless course selection process, supporting students in meeting their academic goals.                                                           |

| User requirements definition      | Functional Requirements: <br/>- The system must accept natural language input from users.<br/>- It should provide accurate course recommendations.<br/>- The interface must allow users to filter courses based on multiple criteria.<br/>Non-Functional Requirements:<br/>  - The system should be user-friendly, with minimal response time.<br/>- It must ensure data security, particularly concerning students' personal information. |
| System architecture               | The system will employ a three-tier architecture:<br/>- Presentation Layer: Manages user interaction with the system.<br/>- Business Logic Layer: Processes user inputs, applying NLP to generate course recommendation.<br/>- Data Access Layer: Interacts with the database to retrieve and store course data and user preference.                                                                                                       |
| System requirements specification | Detailed Functional Requirements:<br/>- The system should display course details including prerequisites, credits, and descriptions.<br/>Detailed Non-Functional Requirements:<br/>- Scalability to handle increases in user numbers and course offerings.<br/>  - Compliance with educational standards and privacy laws.                                                                                                                 |
