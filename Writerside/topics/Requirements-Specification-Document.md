# Requirements Specification Document

## Preface

This document outlines the expected readership and provides a version history of the requirements specification for the Course
Recommendation System. It summarizes the rationale behind each version.

## Introduction

The Course Recommendation System is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing students with personalized course
recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This system will integrate with existing university databases and scheduling tools
to offer a seamless course selection process, supporting students in meeting their academic goals.

## Glossary
