| Introduction                      | The Course Recommendation System is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing students with personalized course recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This system will integrate with existing university databases and scheduling tools to offer a seamless course selection process, supporting students in meeting their academic goals.                                                           |

| User requirements definition      | Functional Requirements: <br/>- The system must accept natural language input from users.<br/>- It should provide accurate course recommendations.<br/>- The interface must allow users to filter courses based on multiple criteria.<br/>Non-Functional Requirements:<br/>  - The system should be user-friendly, with minimal response time.<br/>- It must ensure data security, particularly concerning students' personal information. |
